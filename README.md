# SimpleRayTracer

# description
This program is able to render static images with ray tracing.
NOTE: There is only a CPU side implementation of the ray tracing algorithm.
The program is NOT suited to run real-time rendering applications.
The internal ray tracing sources can also be exproted as an external library.

# project
This project can be built with CMAKE. It is also compatible with visual studio.
There are two libraries requiered by the project:
  1) glm: You MUST build the glm source files to a static library as this is requiered by CMakeLists.txt.
  2) stb_master: Is used by the demo program to write the pixel buffer, generated by the ray tracing application, to an image.
